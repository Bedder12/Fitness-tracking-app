# Fitness-tracking-app
This project is a prototype of a fitness tracking application designed for St8tus4U's training watch. The app allows users to monitor outdoor training activities by visualizing data such as heart rate, speed, altitude, and distance through interactive graphs and maps. It provides features for importing training data, creating and managing activities, and storing user data between sessions.

User Authentication: Users log in via a simple GUI interface.

Data Management: Training data is imported via CSV files and organized by activities, which are user-defined with custom names and dates.

Visualization: The app includes:

* A Map Panel for plotting the training routes based on GPS data (latitude and longitude).
